    "section": "",
    "text": "When watching an NFL football game, everyone loves to witness the highlight plays made by an offense or the hard hits that get laid by the defense. With this, there is sometimes that question lingering about which side of the ball matters more to their team. We all know that some NFL teams have, or have had some outstanding offenses or defenses throughout recent years and the past, but of these elite groups, which ones help their teams succeed the most? The first thing to look at when searching for elite offenses and defenses, is the points scored and points allowed by certain groups.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(nflverse)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n\n\n\nCode\ngames &lt;- load_schedules(seasons = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nhead(games)\n\n\n\n\nCode\ngames |&gt;\n  filter(season == 2019:2023)\n\n\nWarning: There was 1 warning in `filter()`.\nℹ In argument: `season == 2019:2023`.\nCaused by warning in `season == 2019:2023`:\n! longer object length is not a multiple of shorter object length\n\n\n── nflverse games and schedules ────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n\nℹ Data updated: 2024-11-15 17:38:28 CST\n\n\n\n\nCode\nteam_points &lt;- games |&gt;\n  group_by(season, home_team, away_team, home_score, away_score) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    team = c(home_team, away_team),\n    points_scored = c(home_score, away_score),\n    points_allowed = c(away_score, home_score),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  group_by(team) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    total_points_scored = sum(points_scored, na.rm = TRUE),\n    total_points_allowed = sum(points_allowed, na.rm = TRUE)\n  )\n\n\nWarning: Returning more (or less) than 1 row per `summarise()` group was deprecated in\ndplyr 1.1.0.\nℹ Please use `reframe()` instead.\nℹ When switching from `summarise()` to `reframe()`, remember that `reframe()`\n  always returns an ungrouped data frame and adjust accordingly.\n\n\n\n\nCode\nteam_colors &lt;- c(\n  \"ARI\" = \"#97233F\", \"ATL\" = \"#A71930\", \"BAL\" = \"#241773\", \"BUF\" = \"#00338D\",\n  \"CAR\" = \"#0085CA\", \"CHI\" = \"#0B162A\", \"CIN\" = \"#FB4F14\", \"CLE\" = \"#311D00\",\n  \"DAL\" = \"#003594\", \"DEN\" = \"#FB4F14\", \"DET\" = \"#0076B6\", \"GB\" = \"#203731\",\n  \"HOU\" = \"#03202F\", \"IND\" = \"#002C5F\", \"JAX\" = \"#006778\", \"KC\" = \"#E31837\",\n  \"LAC\" = \"#0073CF\", \"LAR\" = \"#003594\", \"MIA\" = \"#008E97\", \"MIN\" = \"#4F2683\",\n  \"NE\" = \"#002244\", \"NO\" = \"#D3BC8D\", \"NYG\" = \"#0B2265\", \"NYJ\" = \"#125740\",\n  \"LV\" = \"#000000\", \"PHI\" = \"#004C54\", \"PIT\" = \"#FFB612\", \"SF\" = \"#AA0000\",\n  \"SEA\" = \"#002244\", \"TB\" = \"#D50A0A\", \"TEN\" = \"#4B92DB\", \"WAS\" = \"#773141\"\n)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nteam_points &lt;- team_points |&gt;\n  mutate(color = team_colors[team])\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(team_points, aes(x = total_points_allowed, y = total_points_scored)) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = color), size = 1) +\n  geom_text(aes(label = team, color = color), vjust =-1, size = 2) +\n  scale_color_identity() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Since 2019, most teams tend to follow a similar trend\",\n    subtitle = \"Except for a couple of outliers...\",\n    caption = \"Source: nflverse | By: Tysen Christie\",\n    x = \"Total Points Allowed\",\n    y = \"Total Points Scored\"\n  ) +\n  theme_gray() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\"),\n        axis.title.x = element_text(face = \"bold\"),\n        axis.title.y = element_text(face = \"bold\"))\n\n\nWarning: Removed 4 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter visualizing this graphic, right off the bat you can point out some teams that have had great, and no so great offenses and defenses overtime. This could make you wonder, which of these teams have actually been successful? There have been many times where a team will have a top offense or defense in the league, but then lack tremendously in skill, depth, you name it on the other side of the ball. If you need an example, the 2022 Miami Dolphins. However, many things can happen during the regular season such as injuries or teams just having an off game, so their are many factors that could possibly go into poor performances by a certain side of the ball. Now I know everyone loves to see the flashy highlight plays made by star running backs and receivers, but people also love to watch defenses make highlight plays too, and sometimes those plays are some of the most impactful plays of the game or even season.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(nflreadr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n\n\n\nCode\npackageVersion(\"dplyr\")\n\n\n[1] '1.1.4'\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndefense &lt;- read.csv(\"2023defense(sheet1).csv\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\nhead(defense)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(defense, aes(x = reorder(Tm,TO), y = TO)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"steelblue\") + \n  labs(\n    title = \"Turnovers can pick apart the elite and the average defenses.\",\n    subtitle = \"Great defenses typically force many turnovers.\",\n    caption = \"Source: Pro Football Reference | By: Tysen Christie\",\n    x = \"Team\",\n    y = \"Total Turnovers Forced in 2023\"\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, size = 10, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 8),\n    axis.title.x = element_text(face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title.y = element_text(face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\")\n  )\n\n\nWarning in mean.default(X[[i]], ...): argument is not numeric or logical:\nreturning NA\nWarning in mean.default(X[[i]], ...): argument is not numeric or logical:\nreturning NA\nWarning in mean.default(X[[i]], ...): argument is not numeric or logical:\nreturning NA\nWarning in mean.default(X[[i]], ...): argument is not numeric or logical:\nreturning NA\nWarning in mean.default(X[[i]], ...): argument is not numeric or logical:\nreturning NA\nWarning in mean.default(X[[i]], ...): argument is not numeric or logical:\nreturning NA\nWarning in mean.default(X[[i]], ...): argument is not numeric or logical:\nreturning NA\nWarning in mean.default(X[[i]], ...): argument is not numeric or logical:\nreturning NA\nWarning in mean.default(X[[i]], ...): argument is not numeric or logical:\nreturning NA\nWarning in mean.default(X[[i]], ...): argument is not numeric or logical:\nreturning NA\nWarning in mean.default(X[[i]], ...): argument is not numeric or logical:\nreturning NA\nWarning in mean.default(X[[i]], ...): argument is not numeric or logical:\nreturning NA\nWarning in mean.default(X[[i]], ...): argument is not numeric or logical:\nreturning NA\nWarning in mean.default(X[[i]], ...): argument is not numeric or logical:\nreturning NA\nWarning in mean.default(X[[i]], ...): argument is not numeric or logical:\nreturning NA\nWarning in mean.default(X[[i]], ...): argument is not numeric or logical:\nreturning NA\nWarning in mean.default(X[[i]], ...): argument is not numeric or logical:\nreturning NA\nWarning in mean.default(X[[i]], ...): argument is not numeric or logical:\nreturning NA\nWarning in mean.default(X[[i]], ...): argument is not numeric or logical:\nreturning NA\nWarning in mean.default(X[[i]], ...): argument is not numeric or logical:\nreturning NA\nWarning in mean.default(X[[i]], ...): argument is not numeric or logical:\nreturning NA\nWarning in mean.default(X[[i]], ...): argument is not numeric or logical:\nreturning NA\nWarning in mean.default(X[[i]], ...): argument is not numeric or logical:\nreturning NA\nWarning in mean.default(X[[i]], ...): argument is not numeric or logical:\nreturning NA\nWarning in mean.default(X[[i]], ...): argument is not numeric or logical:\nreturning NA\nWarning in mean.default(X[[i]], ...): argument is not numeric or logical:\nreturning NA\nWarning in mean.default(X[[i]], ...): argument is not numeric or logical:\nreturning NA\nWarning in mean.default(X[[i]], ...): argument is not numeric or logical:\nreturning NA\nWarning in mean.default(X[[i]], ...): argument is not numeric or logical:\nreturning NA\nWarning in mean.default(X[[i]], ...): argument is not numeric or logical:\nreturning NA\nWarning in mean.default(X[[i]], ...): argument is not numeric or logical:\nreturning NA\nWarning in mean.default(X[[i]], ...): argument is not numeric or logical:\nreturning NA\nWarning in mean.default(X[[i]], ...): argument is not numeric or logical:\nreturning NA\nWarning in mean.default(X[[i]], ...): argument is not numeric or logical:\nreturning NA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThinking back to my main point of offenses and defenses making their teams “successful”, right away you can make some assumptions based off this graph. The Carolina Panthers, Tennessee Titans, and LA Rams clearly forced the least amount of turnovers last season, so did this affect their teams as a whole in any sort of way? Well, without doing any research, the Panthers and Titans were two bottom five teams in the entire NFL last year, but the Rams….. actually made the playoffs! One point that this could make us think about is that maybe offense is more important than defense? Well, maybe that is the case for the Rams at least considering they have two stellar wide receivers in Puka Nacua and Cooper Kupp and a second year running back in Kyren Williams. Don’t let me forget to mention that this Rams offense is also powered by veteran quarterback Matt Stafford as well. Aside from that, if you check out the defensive side of the ball when compared to the offensive side, you can make even more assumptions about certain teams.\n\n\nCode\nstandings &lt;- read.csv(\"standings(Sheet1).csv\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\nhead(standings)\n\n\n                     m  W  L  W.L.

Now it may not be quite as positive as some may have thought after seeing the Rams defensive turnovers, despite still making the playoffs, but there are many things that could play into that. For example, the Rams might not be getting very many turnovers on defense, but maybe they are also not turning the ball over much on offense either. Another thing to notice is that the Ravens had the highest point differential last year, and they were also the team with the most turnovers on the other graph. Most of the time these two things can go hand in hand with each other. However, back to the main point, the Chiefs are also in the same boat as the Rams. They didn’t force very many turnovers last year, but they were ranked very high in point differential and they also ended up winning the Super Bowl that same year. I think that there can still be many arguments made about which side of the ball helps their team succeed more, but I think these graphs do an outstanding job in showing that productive offenses in past years have done a great job at carrying the weight of their not so outstanding defenses."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Code\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(nflverse)\nlibrary(nflreadr)\n\n\nHello\nAs the 2024 NFL season heads into the final weeks, many players and fans are starting to think about the potential award winners for the year. As many NFL fans know, the Offensive Rookie of the Year award is an award that goes to the best performing offensive rookie, which more times than not, tends to be a quarterback. This year, the talented rookie quarterbacks have made the competition for the award pretty fierce, and closer than it looks. In the NFL, quarterbacks have high expectations from their coaches and teams, and these expectations can play a huge role in a rookie quarterbacks performance right from the get go. However, many things can determine a quarterbacks performance, especially a rookie. These players tend to get put into bad situations on bad teams time and time again, so when looking at stats like wins, passing yards and completion percentage, that is always something to take into consideration. However, at the end of the day all that matters is winning, and winning at the quarterback position requires a player to be very well-rounded in every statistic. Quarterback rating is just an overall rating of a quarterbacks performance.\n\n\nCode\nrookieqbs &lt;- read.csv(\"data/2024passing.csv\")\n  Player &lt;- c(\"Jayden Daniels\", \"Bo Nix\", \"Caleb Williams\", \"Drake Maye\")\n  QBR &lt;- c(\"71.8\", \"55.5\", \"47.1\", \"58\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\nrookieqbs_filt &lt;- rookieqbs |&gt;\n  filter(Player %in% c(\"Jayden Daniels\", \"Bo Nix\", \"Caleb Williams\", \"Drake Maye\"))\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(rookieqbs_filt, aes(x = Player, y = QBR, fill = Player)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  theme_gray() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Which ones can do it all?\",\n    subtitle = \"Chicago took Williams with the first overall pick\",\n    x = \"Quarterback\",\n    y = \"QBR\",\n    caption = \"Source: Pro Football Reference | By: Tysen Christie\"\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title.x = element_text(face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title.y = element_text(face = \"bold\"),\n    legend.position = \"none\"\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(\n    limits = c(0, 80),\n    breaks = seq(0, 80, by = 10)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile quarterback ratings do provide a detailed measure of a quarterback’s overall performance, it is also important to break down and compare certain statistics alone. When looking at quarterback statistics at any level, most people note the amount of touchdowns they’ve scored, and interceptions they’ve thrown. It is the quarterback’s main job to help their offense score, whether that is running or throwing the ball. It is also the quarterback’s job to protect the ball while doing all of this. For rookie quarterbacks, the touchdown to interception ratio is a great way to analyze their performances in their first year. NFL defenses are way more complex and talented than defenses at the college level, so for some rookie quarterbacks it can take some time getting used to, and that is very common. Looking at the main four rookie quarterbacks, they all have a few things in common that you can consider when looking at their touchdown to interception ratios. All four of these quarterbacks play on a team that was below .500 last season, none of them have a good offensive line, and none have a reliable superstar on the offensive side of the ball with them.\n\n\nCode\nrookieqbs_long &lt;- rookieqbs_filt |&gt;\n  gather(key = \"Stat\", value = \"Count\", TD, Int)\n\nggplot(rookieqbs_long, aes(x = Player, y = Count, fill = Stat)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  theme_gray() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Striking a balance\",\n    subtitle = \"can the rookies keep this up from here on out?\",\n    x = \"\",\n    y = \"TD - INT\",\n    fill = \"\",\n    caption = \"Source: Pro Football Reference | By: Tysen Christie\"\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"TD\" = \"#4CAF50\", \"Int\" = \"#F44336\")) +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 16, color = \"black\", hjust = 0.5),\n    axis.title.y = element_text(face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12, color = \"black\", hjust = 0.5),\n    legend.position = \"top\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, it’s pretty clear that these rookie quarterbacks are being asked to step up in some really tough scenarios. For these quarterbacks, this makes the ability to put up good passing numbers week to week even more challenging for them. Passing yards per game is a statistic that means more than just how many passing yards a player had. To put up good passing yard numbers, quarterbacks are required to command their offense at all points during games and also make certain adjustments that can open up more plays, which leads to more offensive success. The rookie quarterbacks that do these things the best and catch up fast, tend to put of more passing yards than the ones who need a little more time to develop. Unlike veteran quarterbacks who have played a long time and know their teams playbook by heart, when rookies are able to put up great passing yard numbers in just their first year, it is usually a good sign for their future, and their rankings in the rookie of the year award.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(rookieqbs_filt, aes(x = Player, y = Y.G)) +\n  geom_line(aes(color = Player), size=1) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = Player), size =2) +\n  theme_gray()+\n    labs(\n      title = \"Airing it out\",\n      subtitle = \"The rookies have some big numbers so far in year one\",\n      x = \"\",\n      y = \"Pass Yds/Game\",\n      color = \"Quarterback\",\n      caption = \"Source: Pro Football Reference | By: Tysen Christie\"\n    ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(\n    limits = c(min(rookieqbs_filt$Y.G) -5, 230),\n    expand = expansion(mult = c(0.05, 0.1)),\n    breaks = seq(0, 230, by = 5)\n  ) +\n  theme(\n     axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n     plot.title.y = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 12),\n     plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 16, hjust = 0.5),\n     plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12, color = \"black\", hjust = 0.5),\n     legend.position = \"none\"\n  )\n\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n\n\nWarning in plot_theme(plot): The `plot.title.y` theme element is not defined in\nthe element hierarchy.\n\n\n`geom_line()`: Each group consists of only one observation.\nℹ Do you need to adjust the group aesthetic?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter going through and analyzing all of these different stats put up by these rookies, I think there is one thing that everyone can agree on. This was a very solid rookie quarterback class. However, going back to the main discussion question of who should win rookie of the year, I think there is one name that stands out a little more than the rest. While all of the players above have very similar stats and ratios, I think that Jayden Daniels barely has the edge in passing. However, when you look at rushing stats, it is not even close. So far this season, Jayden Daniels has over double the amount of rushing yards and touchdowns than any other rookie quarterback this year. Like I said previously, the quarterbacks job is to score the ball on offense whether that is by rushing or passing, and not many quarterbacks do the rushing part themselves except for Jayden Daniels. These four first round quarterbacks clearly all have the arm talent, but just a little bit of rushing upside from any quarterback can make them, and their team a lot more dangerous. Jayden Daniels so far has played a huge role in the Washington Commanders comeback story, and I think that he could very easily snag the Rookie of the Year Award, and maybe even a playoff spot that no Commanders fan thought they would have at the beginning of this season."
